    ///
    /// \brief send Sends a message by adding it to the communicator's transmit queue.
    /// \param message The message to send. The communicator takes ownership of the pointer.
    /// \param receipt_required OPTIONAL Indicates that the message should be retransmitted until a receipt is
    /// received from the receiver, or the maximum amount of transmissions has been reached.

    /// \return Returns TRUE if the message was successfully placed in the transmit queue, otherwise FALSE.
    /// \details This places a message into the TX queue for sending.  The communicator sends messages from the queue
    /// based on highest priority, followed by oldest.  The calling code can keep track of the message's status
